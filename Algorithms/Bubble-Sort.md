# Bubble Sort 

**A comparison based sorting algorithm**
+ It iterates left to right comparing every couplet, moving the smaller element to the left.
+ It repeats this process until it no longer moves and element to the left.

# Must know
+ While it is very simple to implement, it is the least efficient of these three sorting methods.
+ Know that it moves one space to the right comparing two elements at a time and moving the smaller on to left.
