# What are algorithms? 

**Algorithms** are a method for solving a problem.  

An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as **input** and produces some value, or set of values, as **output**. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output. We can also view an algorithm as a tool for solving a well-specified **computational problem**. 

--example: 
Sort a sequence of numbers into nondecreasing order
**Input**: A sequence of *n* numbers 
**Output**: A permutation (reordering)
