# Recursion 

**An expression such that each term is generated by repeating a particular mathematical operation.**

In other words,  

**Recursion is a function that calls itself**

+ **Recursive case** a conditional statement that is used to trigger the recursion.
+ **Base case** a conditional statement that is used to break the recursion.

# Recursion Vs. Iteration
+ Recursion is, usually, more expressive and easier to implement.
+ Iteration uses less memory.
+ Recursion is usually much slower because all function calls must be stored in a stack to allow the return back to the caller functions.

Recursion                         | Iteration
----------------------------------|----------------------------------
recursive method (array, n)       | iterative method (array)
  if array[n] is not nil          |   for n from 0 to size of array
    print array[n]                |     print(array[n])
    recursive method(array, n+1)  |
  else                            |
    exit loop                     |
