# What is Boostrap?
Bootstrap is a responsive CSS framework. Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements (Responsive Design). With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width. You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding a Bootstrap CDN (Content Delivery Network).
