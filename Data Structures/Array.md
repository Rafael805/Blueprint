# Array

An array is a collection of variables, each with a unique numerical index. They allow very fast index based lookups. They form the basis for many other data structures, such as Matrices, Vectors and oftren Trees as well. They are one of the most fundamental of all data structures and a computer's memory is nothing but a huge array of bits.
