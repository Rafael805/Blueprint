# Array

An array is the oldest, most commonly used data structures. It is a collection of variables, each with a unique numerical index. They allow very fast index based lookups. They form the basis for many other data structures, such as Matrices, Vectors and oftren Trees as well. They are one of the most fundamental of all data structures and a computer's memory is nothing but a huge array of bits.

# Must know 

+ Optimal for indexing; bad at searching, inserting, and deleting (except at the end).
+ **Linear arrays**, or one dimensional arrays, are the most basic.
Are static in size, meaning that they are declared with a fixed size.
+ **Dynamic arrays** are like one dimensional arrays, but have reserved space for additional elements.
If a dynamic array is full, it copies it's contents to a larger array.
+ **Two dimensional** arrays have x and y indices like a grid or nested arrays.
