# Binary Tree

**Binary trees** are fantastically versatile. It's a collection of nodes, each has two child nodes and each has one parent node. It is used in creating Binary Search Trees, heaps, seraching and sorting. 

Binary trees are often used to transform an algorithm from linear time to Log(n) time.


# Must know 
+ Tree like data structure where every node has at most two children (one left and right child node).
+ Designed to optimize searching and sorting.
+ Used to make **binary search trees**.

# Big O Efficiency 
+ Indexing: Binary Search Tree: ```O(log n)```
+ Search: Binary Search Tree: ```O(log n)```
+ Insertion: Binary Search Tree: ```O(log n)```
