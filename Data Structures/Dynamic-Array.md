# Dynamic Array

**Dynamic arrays** are arrays that allocate extra space ahead of time with the expectation that they will grow. Each time the array reaches max capacity, it grows by some factor of size - around 1.5 to 2 times the previous size. The biggest risk here is around size and growing uncontrollably.
