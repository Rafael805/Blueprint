# Hash Table 

What if you hae a list of millions of names and you need to search it thousands of times a second and you want to know if it contains any particular search string?

**Hash tables** allow extremely fast lookups of arbitrary keys, like string, complex data types, etx. It is an array that is not indexed necessarily by integers, but by hash keys. Hash tables are often used to solve the dictionary problem. A dictionary is a data structure supporting efficient insert, delete, and search operations. 

-- example:
Items may be instances of a student class, the **keys** are students’ names, and the returned values are the students’ ID numbers and grades in the course. We assume that keys are unique (different items have different keys).
