# Heaps 

**Heaps** are binary tree structures that maintain two properties:

1. Shape property: They are complete trees meaning that all rows are filled with the exception of the last row. If the last row is unfilled, then it has been filled from left to right.
2. Heap property: All parents are either >= or <= their children, depending on if it is a Max-Heap or Min-Heap, respectively.
