# Linked List 

What do you do if you'be got a list of items you need to add and remove quickly? Arrays are not good because eerytime you add/remove and item, you have to shift many others.

A **linked list** allows fast insertion and deletion of items as well as dynamic sized lists. 

Linked lists are a series of "nodes" with information and pointers to the next nodes in the list.
