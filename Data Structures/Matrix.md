# Matrix

A matrix is usually a multidimensional array with a collection of predefined operations. Matrices are conceptually different to an array. Thay have become ubiquitous in graphics programming.They have an interesting ability to store more than one transformation matrix in a single matrix. We can rotate, scale, and translae a virtual object, all with a single matrix.

Matrices can find paths through mazes, or tell how many paths there are from Node X to Node Y.
