# Queue

Queues are the classis "First in, First out" FIFO data structure.

They are very common, for example in event driven operating systems (OS). A queue is used to store the events occuring in the system. 

The OS msut respond to events in the order they occur. For instance, as you type every time you hit a key, the OS registers which key you hit in an event queue.
