# What is NPM 
*npm is the package manager for javascript.*

If we want to include something like jQuery or the Bootstrap javascript library or any other javascript libray, we have to use a script tag. But if we're writing node in the server side and we want to include a library or something that someone else wrote we cannot add a script tag because there is no HTML. We are just dealing with Node. 

The way that we get those libraries when we're writing server side jaascript/node is through NPM. Rather that calling them libraries NPM refers to them as packages but it's the same idea. Packages are just code that someone else has written that we can include to our own projects. All the packages are centralized in the NPM website. Awesome! Furthermore, NPM has a command line tool that lets you install things really easily. 

All you have to do is type ```npm install <name_of_package>``` (as long as NPM knows about that package) That's it. You don't have to go find a CDN/link/copy and pasting.
