## Machine Learning
**Arthur Samuel (1959)**: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 

**Well-posed Learning Problem**   
**Tom Mitchell (1998)**: A computer program is said to learn from experience E, with respect to some task T, and some performance measure P, if its performance on T as measured by P improves with experience E. 

Example: Playing checkers  
  
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

**Supervised Learning** 
+ Most common.
+ Already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
+ Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems.

**Regresion:** Predict continuous valued output. Meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. When the target variable that weâ€™re trying to predict is continuous we call the learning problem a regression problem. 
Example: Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture

**Classification:** Discrete valued output. We are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem. 
Example: Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign (0 no / 1 yes) 

**Unsupervised Learning** 
+ Allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results should look like.
+ We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.
+ With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.

**Clustering:** Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.

**Non-clustering:** The "Cocktail Party Algorithm", allows you to find structure in a chaotic environment. (i.e. identifying individual voices and music from a mesh of sounds at a cocktail party).

**m** = # of training examples / set  
**x**'s = "input" variable / features  
**y**'s = "outout" variable / "target" variable
