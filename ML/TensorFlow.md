## TensorFlow  

**Virtualenv:**  
+ virtual Python environment isolated from other Python development, incapable of interfering with or being affected by other Python programs on the same machine.

```
$ mkdir 'directory name'
$ cd 'directory name' 
$ virtualenv 'project name' 
```
 


To use TensorFlow you have to activate the Virtualenv environment again  

```
$ source 'project name'/bin/ativate   # If using bash.
('project name')$  # Your prompt should change. 

# When you are done using TensorFlow, deactivate the environment.
('project name')$ deactivate
```

When done using TensorFlow, deactivate environent  

```
(tensorflow)$ deactivate  

# Your prompt should change back
```
