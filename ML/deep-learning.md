## What is deep learning? 

Deep learning is the study of artificial neural networks and related machine learning algorithms that contain more than one hidden layer. Deep learning is an exciting branch of machine learning that uses a lot of data to teach computers how to do things that only humans were capable of before. Deep learning is a wonderful tool to solve problems, such as discovering new medicines, understanding natural language, understanding documents, and for example, ranking them for search.
