As a web application in which you can create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations as well as text, the Jupyter Notebook is one of the ideal tools to help you to gain the data science skills you need.

## What Is A Jupyter Notebook?

In this case, "notebook" or "notebook documents" denote documents that contain both code and rich text elements, such as figures, links, equations, ... Because of the mix of code and text elements, these documents are the ideal place to bring together an analysis description and its results as well as they can be executed perform the data analysis in real time.

"Jupyter" is a loose acronym meaning Julia, Python, and R. These programming languages were the first target languages of the Jupyter application, but nowadays, the notebook technology also supports many other languages. 

The main components of the whole environment are, on the one hand, the notebooks themselves and the application. On the other hand, you also have a notebook kernel and a notebook dashboard.

## What Is The Jupyter Notebook App?

As a server-client application, the Jupyter Notebook App allows you to edit and run your notebooks via a web browser. The application can be executed on a PC without Internet access or it can be installed on a remote server, where you can access it through the Internet.

Its two main components are the kernels and a dashboard.

A kernel is a program that runs and introspects the userâ€™s code. The Jupyter Notebook App has a kernel for Python code, but there are also kernels available for other programming languages.

The dashboard of the application not only shows you the notebook documents that you have made and can reopen but can also be used to manage the kernels: you can which ones are running and shut them down if necessary.

## Getting Started With Jupyter Notebooks
Run the following command to open up the application:
```
jupyter notebook
```  
Then you'll see the application opening in the web browser on the following address: http://localhost:8888.  

The "Files" tab is where all your files are kept, the "Running" tab keeps track of all your processes and the third tab, "Clusters", is provided by IPython parallel, IPython's parallel computing framework. It allows you to control many individual engines, which are an extended version of the IPython kernel.
