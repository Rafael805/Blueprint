### What is a logistic classifier?

A logistic classifier is what's called the *linear classifier*. It takes input, for example pixels in an image, and applies a linear function to them to generate its predictions. A linear function is just a giant matric multiplier.

It takes all the inputs as a big vector that will "X" and multiplies them with a matric to generate its predictions, one per output class.
