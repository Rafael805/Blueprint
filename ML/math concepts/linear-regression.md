# What is linear regression?

You feed it your training examples and it finds the parameters that make the linear model fit best to your data. This is called **training** the model. 

For linear regression problems, people typically use a cost function that measures the distance between the linear model preditions and the training examples; the objective is to minimize this distance.

# Logistic regression VS linear regression?
The key difference is that linear regression predicts a continuous outcome versus logitic regression which computes a discrete outcome. Continuous means that we can have values range infintly but for a discrete outcome it's either one thing or it's another.   
Discrete outcome: Blue or red (Yes or no) 
Continous outcome: What is the next value in a series of house prices (infinite number of possibilities)
