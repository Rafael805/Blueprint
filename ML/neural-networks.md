## Neural Networks 

A lot of the important work on neural networks happen in the 80s and in the 90s, but back then computers were slow and data sets very tiny. The research didn't really find many applications in the real world. As a result, the first decade of the 21st century, neural networks have completely disappeared from the world of machine learning Working with neural networks was definitely fringe.  

It's only in the last few years, first in speech recognition around 2009, and then in computer vision around 2012, that neural networks made a big comeback. What changed? A lot more data, and cheap GPU's. Today neural networks are everywhere especially if you're working with data, analytics, and predictions.
