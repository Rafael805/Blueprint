# Supervised Learning

+ Most common.
+ Already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.
+ Supervised learning problems are categorized into "regression" and "classification" problems.

### collect training data --> train classifier --> make predictions 

# Classification 
Discrete valued output. We are trying to map input variables into discrete categories. When y can take on only a small number of discrete values (such as if, given the living area, we wanted to predict if a dwelling is a house or an apartment, say), we call it a classification problem. 
Example: Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign (0 no / 1 yes) 

# Regression
Predict continuous valued output. Meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. When the target variable that weâ€™re trying to predict is continuous we call the learning problem a regression problem. 

--example: Given a picture of a person, we have to predict their age on the basis of the given picture
