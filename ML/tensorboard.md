# What is TensorBoard?

TensorBoard is graph visualization software included with any standard TensorFlow
installation. 

In Google’s own words: *“The computations you'll use TensorFlow for - like training
a massive deep neural network - can be complex and confusing. To make it easier to understand,
debug, and optimize TensorFlow programs, we've included a suite of visualization tools called
TensorBoard.”*

When a user perform certain operations in a TensorBoard-activated TensorFlow program, these
operations are exported to an event file. TensorBoard is able to convert these event files to
graphs that can give insight into a model’s behavior. Learning to use TensorBoard early and
often will make working with TensorFlow that much more enjoyable and productive.
