## TensorFlow  

**Tensors:** Tensors are multilinear maps from vector spaces to the real numbers.  

**Virtualenv:**  
+ virtual Python environment isolated from other Python development, incapable of interfering with or being affected by other Python programs on the same machine.

```   
$ mkdir 'directory name'
$ cd 'directory name' 
$ virtualenv 'project name' 
```   

To use TensorFlow you have to activate the Virtualenv environment again if using bash.

```
$ source 'project name'/bin/ativate   
('project name')$  
# Your prompt should change. 
```

When done using TensorFlow, deactivate environent  

```
(tensorflow)$ deactivate  
# Your prompt should change back
```

List all packages installed   
```
$ pip list 
```

### Python 

Check python version  
```
$ python --version
```

Exit python in terminal  
```
$ exit()  
```

change python command 
```
$ alias python='python3'
```
