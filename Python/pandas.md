# What is Pandas?

The Pandas library is built on NumPy and provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. Panda series and dataframes allow us to store large datasets and extract information from them. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.

### Series
Think of Series as an one-dimensional labeled array, list, or column capable of holding any data type. By default, it will assign an index label to each item in the Series ranging from 0 to N, where N is the number of items in the Series minus one.

### DataFrame
A Data in Pandas is often contained in a structure called a dataframe. A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. For example, string, int, float, or boolean. You can think of a dataframe being similar to an Excel spreadsheet or a database table. 

 Import the pandas library using: 
 ```import pandas as pd```
