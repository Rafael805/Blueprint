# What is Pandas?

Panda series and dataframes allow us to store large datasets and extract information from them. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.

**Series**
Think of Series as an one-dimensional object that is similar to an array, list, or column in a database. By default, it will assign an index label to each item in the Series ranging from 0 to N, where N is the number of items in the Series minus one.

**Dataframe** 
Data in Pandas is often contained in a structure called a dataframe. A dataframe is a two dimensional labeled data structure with columns which can be different type if necessary. For example, string, int, float, or boolean. You can think of a dataframe being similar to an Excel spreadsheet or a database table. 

 Import the pandas library using: 
 ```import pandas as pd```
