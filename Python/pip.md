# What is Pip? 

```pip``` is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.

One major advantage of pip is the ease of its command-line interface, which makes installing Python software packages as easy as issuing one command:
```
$ pip install <package_name>
```

Users can also easily remove the package:
```
$ pip uninstall <package_name>
```

List all packages installed   
```
$ pip list 
```
