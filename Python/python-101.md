# What is Python?

Python is a high-level, dynamically typed multiparadigm programming language. Python code is often said to be almost like pseudocode, since it allows you to express very powerful ideas in very few lines of code while being very readable

### Python versions
There are two different supported versions of Python, Python 2.7 and 3.6. Code written for 2.7 may not work under 3.5 and vice versa.

You can check your Python version at the command line by running ```python --version```

Python includes several built-in container types: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

**Lists**: Python equivalent of an array, but is resizeable and can contain elements of different types.  
**Dictionaries**: stores (key, value) pairs, similar to a Map in Java or an object in Javascript.   
**Sets**: unordered collection of distinct elements.  
**Tuples**: an (immutable) ordered list of values. A tuple is in many ways similar to a list; one of the most important differences is that tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries and as elements of sets, while lists cannot.  


Check python version
