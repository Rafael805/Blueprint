# What is a Raspberry Pi?

A Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer originally designed for education. The Raspberry Pi is slower than a modern laptop or desktop but is still a complete Linux computer and can provide all the expected abilities.

+ $35 Computer the size of a credit card
+ Uses GNU/Linux Operating System
+ Model B has 512 MB RAM, 2 USB Ports, Ethernet, video out, and HDMI
+ Operating System loaded on SD card
+ Storage is based on SD card size

# What kind of operating system does the Raspberry Pi run?

The Raspberry Pi was designed for the Linux operating system. Two of the most popular options are Raspbian, which is based on the Debian operating system, and Pidora, which is based on the Fedora operating system. I personally use Raspbian. For beginners, either of these two work well; which one you choose to use is a matter of personal preference.

If you would like to experiment with multiple Linux distributions and aren't sure which one you want, or you just want an easier experience in case something goes wrong, try **NOOBS**, which stands for New Out Of Box Software. When you first boot from the SD card, you will be given a menu with multiple distributions (including Raspbian and Pidora) to choose from. If you decide to try a different one, or if something goes wrong with your system, you simply hold the Shift key at boot to return to this menu and start over.

# Raspberry Pi vs Arduino

Raspberry Pi is different than the Arduino (another famous, super-inexpensive computer). The Raspberry Pi is a single board computer; the Arduino is considered a "micro controller". The key is that the Raspberry Pi can run an OS (Linux, usually), which can then run programs.

The Arduino will only run a single program, called a Sketch, that does a specific programmed activity. You're likely to use an Arduino to control a specific aspect of a device, like a robot's arm. You might use a Raspberry Pi for anything where you'd want a fully functional, inexpensive computer.
