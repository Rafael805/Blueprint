# What is Redux?
*Redux provides an easy way to centralize the state of your application.*  

Redux is a concept of data storing and communication within an application in the client-side (in the browser). Redux is like “a backend’s database on the client-side where you store all the required information that are required in order to generate the view”. It helps you to query SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE the data (a record) into the JSON’s database (called also single-state tree).
