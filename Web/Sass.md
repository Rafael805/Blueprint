# What is Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets)? 

Sass is an easy-to-use styling language that helps reduce a lot of the repetition and maintainability challenges of traditional CSS. Learning Sass will not only let you scale styles when working on big web development projects, it will also make it much faster and efficient to write reusable styles from scratch for smaller projects. Transitioning from CSS to SCSS (Sassy CSS) is pretty smooth due to the familiar syntax. 

Sass can't be directly interpreted by your browser, so it must first be converted, or compiled, to CSS before the browser can directly understand it.

Compile SCSS to CSS by typing the following command in the terminal that takes in two arguments:

The input (main.scss)
The location of where to place that output (main.css)

```
sass main.scss main.css
```
